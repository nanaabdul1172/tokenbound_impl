## 1. Upgradeable Library

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/upgradeable/src/lib.rs`

Shared `rlib` compiled into every contract. Provides: upgrade timelock, pause guard, admin management, version counter, and TTL extension helpers.

### 1.1 Upgrade Timelock Constants

| Constant | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UPGRADE_DELAY_LEDGERS` | `u32` | `17_280` | Ledgers between `schedule_upgrade` and `commit_upgrade`. At 5 s/ledger ≈ 24 hours. Increase for more stakeholder reaction time; decrease for faster patch cycles. |
| `LEDGER_SECONDS` | `u32` | `5` | Assumed ledger cadence. Used only to derive `LEDGERS_PER_DAY`. Does not affect on-chain behaviour (ledger sequence numbers, not wall-clock time, are used). |
| `SECONDS_PER_DAY` | `u32` | `86_400` | Informational. Used to derive `LEDGERS_PER_DAY`. |
| `LEDGERS_PER_DAY` | `u32` | `17_280` | Derived: `86_400 / 5`. Informational only. |

### 1.2 Storage TTL Constants

| Constant | Type | Default | Impact of Changing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_TTL_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS` | `u32` | `518_400` (30 days) | When remaining TTL falls below this threshold an extension is triggered. Raising it means entries refresh more eagerly (higher fees); lowering it risks expiry of rarely-touched state. |
| `DEFAULT_TTL_EXTEND_TO_LEDGERS` | `u32` | `1_728_000` (100 days) | Target TTL set during extension. **Must be greater than `DEFAULT_TTL_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS`.** Increasing reduces how often extension transactions run; decreasing saves rent but requires more frequent activity. |

> **Warning:** If `DEFAULT_TTL_EXTEND_TO_LEDGERS` is set below `DEFAULT_TTL_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS`, every write will re-trigger an extension on the same ledger, wasting fees.

### 1.3 UpgradeKey Storage Layout

| Key | Storage Type | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UpgradeKey::Admin` | Instance | `Address` | Contract administrator. Required for all admin-gated operations. |
| `UpgradeKey::Version` | Instance | `u32` | Monotonically incrementing version. Starts at `1`; bumped by `commit_upgrade()`. |
| `UpgradeKey::Paused` | Instance | `bool` | When `true`, all state-mutating entry points revert via `require_not_paused()`. |
| `UpgradeKey::PendingUpgrade` | Instance | `(BytesN<32>, u32)` | Tuple of `(new_wasm_hash, scheduled_at_ledger)`. Written by `schedule_upgrade()`; consumed by `commit_upgrade()`. |

### 1.4 Admin & Upgrade Functions

| Function | Auth Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule_upgrade(new_wasm_hash)` | Admin | Records new WASM hash + current ledger sequence. Emits `upgrade_scheduled`. Cannot be committed until `UPGRADE_DELAY_LEDGERS` have elapsed. |
| `commit_upgrade()` | Admin | Asserts `current_ledger >= scheduled_at + UPGRADE_DELAY_LEDGERS`, removes pending entry, increments version, then calls `update_current_contract_wasm()`. |
| `cancel_upgrade()` | Admin | Removes `UpgradeKey::PendingUpgrade` without applying the WASM swap. |
| `pause()` | Admin | Sets `UpgradeKey::Paused = true`. All guarded functions revert. |
| `unpause()` | Admin | Sets `UpgradeKey::Paused = false`. |
| `transfer_admin(new_admin)` | Admin | Overwrites `UpgradeKey::Admin`. Old admin loses all privileges immediately. |

---

## 2. EventManager Contract

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/event_manager/src/lib.rs`

Primary user-facing contract. Organizers create events; buyers purchase tickets; the contract escrows ticket revenue until the event ends, then releases funds to the organizer.

### 2.1 Hard-Coded Constants

> These are baked into the WASM binary. Changing them requires a contract upgrade.

| Constant | Type | Default | Range | Impact of Changing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_STRING_BYTES` | `u32` | `200` | 1 – 200 | Maximum byte length for `theme` and `event_type`. Very long strings increase ledger entry size and fees. Values shorter than 1 byte are rejected with `InvalidStringInput`. |
| `MAX_TICKET_TIERS` | `u32` | `32` | 1 – 32 | Maximum ticket tiers per event. Each tier is stored as a `TicketTier` struct. Raising this increases per-event storage; lowering prevents flexible pricing models. |
| `MAX_TICKETS_PER_EVENT` | `u128` | `500_000` | 1 – 500_000 | Maximum total tickets across all tiers. Prevents a single event from monopolising network state. |
| `MAX_TICKET_PRICE` | `i128` | `10_000_000_000_000_000` | >= 0 | Maximum `ticket_price` in the token's smallest unit. Prevents overflow in `total_price = price × quantity`. |
| `MAX_ORGANIZER_OPEN_EVENTS` | `u32` | `50` | 1 – u32::MAX | Maximum concurrent active events per organizer. Prevents resource exhaustion. |
| `EVENT_CREATE_COOLDOWN_SECS` | `u64` | `120` | 0 – any u64 | Minimum seconds between successive event creations by the same organizer. `0` disables rate limiting. |
| `MAX_EVENT_DURATION_SECS` | `u64` | `31_622_400` | 1 – any u64 | Maximum allowed span between `start_date` and `end_date` (366 × 86 400 ≈ one leap year). |
| `MAX_EVENT_START_AHEAD_SECS` | `u64` | `158_112_000` | 1 – any u64 | Maximum seconds in the future that `start_date` may be set (5 × 366 days). |
| `MAX_PURCHASE_QUANTITY` | `u128` | `500` | 1 – u128::MAX | Maximum tickets per single `purchase_tickets()` call. Prevents excessive NFT minting gas in one transaction. |

### 2.2 `CreateEventParams` Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Constraints | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `organizer` | `Address` | — | Any valid Stellar address | Must call `require_auth()`. Only this address can cancel, update, or withdraw funds for the event. |
| `theme` | `String` | — | 1 – `MAX_STRING_BYTES` bytes | Display name. Empty or too-long values → `InvalidStringInput`. |
| `event_type` | `String` | — | 1 – `MAX_STRING_BYTES` bytes | Category label (e.g. `"Conference"`). Same length rules as `theme`. |
| `start_date` | `u64` | — | `now < start_date ≤ now + MAX_EVENT_START_AHEAD_SECS` | Unix timestamp (seconds). Must be strictly in the future and within the lookahead window. |
| `end_date` | `u64` | — | `start_date < end_date`; `(end − start) ≤ MAX_EVENT_DURATION_SECS` | Determines when `withdraw_funds()` becomes callable. |
| `ticket_price` | `i128` | — | `0 ≤ price ≤ MAX_TICKET_PRICE` | Default price when no tiers provided. `0` = free event (no token transfer). |
| `total_tickets` | `u128` | — | `1 ≤ n ≤ MAX_TICKETS_PER_EVENT` (when no tiers) | Ignored when `tiers` is non-empty; supply is summed from tier configs instead. |
| `payment_token` | `Address` | — | Any SEP-41 token contract | Token used for payments and refunds. Must implement `transfer()`. Mismatches cause fund loss — choose carefully. |
| `tiers` | `Vec<TierConfig>` | `[]` (empty) | 0 – `MAX_TICKET_TIERS` elements | When empty, a single `"General"` tier is auto-created. When non-empty, each tier is validated independently. |

### 2.3 `TierConfig` Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `String` | 1 – `MAX_STRING_BYTES` bytes | Human-readable tier label (e.g. `"VIP"`, `"Early Bird"`). |
| `price` | `i128` | `0 ≤ price ≤ MAX_TICKET_PRICE` | Per-ticket price for this tier. Each tier can have a distinct price. `0` = free tier. |
| `total_quantity` | `u128` | `1 ≤ n ≤ MAX_TICKETS_PER_EVENT` | Supply for this tier. The aggregate across all tiers must also satisfy `1 ≤ sum ≤ MAX_TICKETS_PER_EVENT`. |

### 2.4 Bulk-Purchase Discount Schedule

Encoded in `calculate_total_price()`. Requires a contract upgrade to change.

| Min Quantity | Discount | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| 1 – 4 | None | `price × quantity` |
| 5 – 9 | 5% (500 bps) | `price × quantity × 9500 / 10_000` |
| 10+ | 10% (1000 bps) | `price × quantity × 9000 / 10_000` |

### 2.5 `DataKey` Storage Layout

| Key | Storage | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Event(u32)` | Persistent | `Event` | Full event record keyed by `event_id`. |
| `ArchivedEvent(u32)` | Persistent | `ArchivedEvent` | Compact summary written by `archive_event()`. Original `Event` entry is removed. |
| `EventCounter` | Instance | `u32` | Monotonically incrementing event ID. Starts at `0`. |
| `TicketFactory` | Instance | `Address` | Address of the `TicketFactory` contract. Set once in `initialize()`. |
| `RefundClaimed(u32, Address)` | Persistent | `bool` | Prevents double refunds. Set to `true` after a successful `claim_refund()`. |
| `EventBuyers(u32)` | Persistent | `Vec<Address>` | Ordered list of unique buyer addresses. Appended on each buyer's first purchase. |
| `EventTiers(u32)` | Persistent | `Vec<TicketTier>` | Live tier state including `sold_quantity`. Updated on every purchase. |
| `BuyerPurchase(u32, Address)` | Persistent | `BuyerPurchase` | Cumulative `quantity` and `total_paid` per `(event, buyer)`. Used for refund amounts. |
| `Waitlist(u32)` | Persistent | `Vec<Address>` | Optional waitlist. Cleared on `cancel_event()`. |
| `EventBalance(u32)` | Persistent | `i128` | Running total of payment tokens held by the contract for this event. |
| `FundsWithdrawn(u32)` | Persistent | `bool` | Prevents double withdrawal. Set in `withdraw_funds()`. |
| `OrganizerOpenEventCount(Address)` | Persistent | `u32` | Count of active events per organizer for rate-limiting. |
| `OrganizerLastCreateTs(Address)` | Instance | `u64` | Ledger timestamp of organizer's most recent event creation. |

---

## 3. TicketFactory Contract

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/ticket_factory/src/lib.rs`

Deploys a fresh `TicketNFT` WASM instance for each event. Called internally by `EventManager` during event creation.

### 3.1 Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Constraints | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Address` | Any valid Stellar address | Controls `deploy_ticket()` and all upgrade/pause operations. Normally set to the `EventManager` address so it can autonomously deploy NFT contracts. |
| `ticket_wasm_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | 32-byte hash of uploaded WASM | WASM hash of the `TicketNFT` contract. Must be uploaded to the network before factory deployment. Changing it (via upgrade) affects all future NFT deployments. |

### 3.2 `DataKey` Storage Layout

| Key | Storage | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Admin` | Instance | `Address` | Factory administrator for `require_auth()` checks in `deploy_ticket()`. |
| `TicketWasmHash` | Instance | `BytesN<32>` | WASM hash for all NFT contract deployments. Updatable only through the upgrade mechanism. |
| `TotalTickets` | Instance | `u32` | Running count of deployed ticket contracts. Starts at `0`; incremented to 1-indexed on each deployment. |
| `TicketContract(u32)` | Persistent | `Address` | Maps `ticket_id` (1-indexed) to the deployed NFT contract address. |

### 3.3 Error Codes

| Code | Name | When Triggered |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `NotInitialized` | `Admin` or `TicketWasmHash` not found in instance storage. |
| 2 | `Unauthorized` | Reserved — auth failures surface via `require_auth()` panic. |

---

## 4. TicketNFT Contract

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/ticket_nft/src/lib.rs`

Non-fungible token contract where each address may hold at most one token. Tokens are sequentially ID'd starting at `1`.

### 4.1 Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `minter` | `Address` | Sole address authorised to call `mint_ticket_nft()`. In production this is the `EventManager` contract address. Also controls metadata updates on tickets without a registered event. |

### 4.2 Mint Behaviour & Defaults

| Parameter | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NextTokenId` (auto) | `u128` | `1` | Sequential token IDs stored in instance storage. Never reused after a burn. |
| `metadata.name` | `String` | `"Ticket"` | Applied at mint. Can be updated post-mint via `update_metadata()`. |
| `metadata.tier` | `String` | `"General"` | Default tier label. Update via `update_metadata()`. |
| `metadata.event_id` | `u32` | `0` | When `0`, metadata admin rights belong to the minter. When `> 0`, the registered organizer in `EventInfo(event_id)` controls metadata. |
| `token_uri` default | `String` | `"onchain://ticket"` | Returned by `token_uri()` when no `OffChainMetadata` is set. Override per-token via `update_off_chain_uri()`. |

### 4.3 Transfer Rules

- Each address may hold **at most 1 token**. `RecipientAlreadyHasTicket` is returned if the recipient's balance > 0.
- The `from` address must be the current owner; `Unauthorized` is returned otherwise.
- `TicketMetadata` is retained through transfers — it is bound to the `token_id`, not the owner address.

### 4.4 `DataKey` Storage Layout

| Key | Storage | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Minter` | Instance | `Address` | Address authorised to mint. Set in constructor. |
| `NextTokenId` | Instance | `u128` | Next token ID to assign. Starts at `1`. |
| `Owner(u128)` | Persistent | `Address` | Current owner of `token_id`. Removed on burn (`is_valid()` returns `false` when missing). |
| `Balance(Address)` | Persistent | `u128` | `0` or `1`. Enforces the one-ticket-per-address invariant. |
| `Metadata(u128)` | Persistent | `TicketMetadata` | On-chain metadata: `name`, `description`, `image`, `event_id`, `tier`. |
| `OffChain(u128)` | Persistent | `OffChainMetadata` | Optional off-chain URI override: `uri`, `updated_at`. When present, `token_uri()` returns this URI. |
| `EventInfo(u32)` | Persistent | `EventInfo` | Registered event metadata: `event_name`, `organizer`. Determines who can update token metadata. |

### 4.5 Error Codes

| Code | Name | When Triggered |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `UserAlreadyHasTicket` | `mint_ticket_nft()` called for a recipient whose `balance > 0`. |
| 2 | `InvalidTokenId` | `token_id` does not have an `Owner` entry (token does not exist or was burned). |
| 3 | `Unauthorized` | `transfer_from()` caller is not the owner of the token. |
| 4 | `RecipientAlreadyHasTicket` | `transfer_from()` target address already holds a ticket. |
| 5 | `NotInitialized` | `Minter` not found in instance storage. |
| 6 | `MetadataNotFound` | `Metadata(token_id)` entry is absent despite the token existing. |
| 7 | `OnlyOrganizerCanUpdate` | `update_metadata()` called for a token with a registered `event_id` but the caller is not the event organizer. |

---

## 5. TbaRegistry Contract

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/tba_registry/src/lib.rs`

Factory and directory for Token-Bound Accounts. Each TBA address is deterministically derived from `(implementation_hash, token_contract, token_id, salt)`.

### 5.1 Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Address` | Upgrade admin for the registry itself. Does not control individual TBA accounts. |
| `tba_account_wasm_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | WASM hash deployed for every `create_account()` call. Changing this (via upgrade) affects only future TBA deployments — existing TBAs are unaffected. |

### 5.2 `create_account()` Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `implementation_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | Conceptually the TBA "version". Together with `salt` allows multiple TBAs per NFT. |
| `token_contract` | `Address` | The NFT contract this TBA is bound to. Must implement `owner_of(u128) -> Address`. |
| `token_id` | `u128` | The specific NFT token that controls this TBA. The caller must be the current NFT owner. |
| `salt` | `BytesN<32>` | User-supplied entropy for deterministic address derivation. Reusing the same salt for identical parameters → `AccountAlreadyDeployed`. |

### 5.3 Address Derivation

The composite salt is computed as:

```
SHA-256(
  impl_hash[32]
  || SHA-256(token_contract_xdr)
  || token_id_be[16]
  || salt[32]
)
```

This value is passed to `env.deployer().with_current_contract(composite_salt).deploy_v2(wasm_hash, [])`. The resulting address is fully deterministic and can be predicted via `get_account()` before deployment.

### 5.4 `DataKey` Storage Layout

| Key | Storage | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ImplementationWasmHash` | Instance | `BytesN<32>` | WASM hash for `TbaAccount` deployment. Set in constructor. |
| `DeployedAccount(BytesN<32>)` | Persistent | `Address` | Maps `composite_salt → deployed TBA address`. Presence used as the "already deployed" guard. |
| `AccountCount(Address, u128)` | Persistent | `u32` | Number of TBAs deployed for a given `(token_contract, token_id)` pair. |

### 5.5 Error Codes

| Code | Name | When Triggered |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AccountAlreadyDeployed` | A TBA with the same composite salt already exists in persistent storage. |
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | `ImplementationWasmHash` not found in instance storage. |

---

## 6. TbaAccount Contract

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/tba_account/src/lib.rs`

Smart-wallet bound to a specific NFT. Whoever holds the NFT controls the TBA. Ownership is checked live via cross-contract call on every operation.

### 6.1 `initialize()` Parameters

Called once by the `TbaRegistry` immediately after deployment.

| Parameter | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `token_contract` | `Address` | NFT contract whose `owner_of()` is called on every `execute()` and `__check_auth()`. |
| `token_id` | `u128` | Specific NFT token ID. Stored as `u128` — no `u64` truncation (verified by fuzz test `test_large_token_id_success`, supports IDs > `u64::MAX`). |
| `implementation_hash` | `BytesN<32>` | Stored for auditing purposes only. Not used in runtime logic. |
| `salt` | `BytesN<32>` | Stored for auditing purposes only. Corresponds to the registry's deployment salt. |

### 6.2 Nonce

A `u64` counter in instance storage under `DataKey::Nonce`. Starts at `0`; incremented by `1` on every successful `execute()` call. Publicly readable via `nonce()`. Emitted in the `TransactionExecuted` event for replay-protection and sequencing.

### 6.3 Ownership Transfer Behaviour

There is **no explicit ownership transfer function**. Ownership automatically follows the NFT: when the underlying `TicketNFT` token is transferred via `transfer_from()`, the new address becomes the TBA owner and gains `execute()` rights on the next call. The old owner's authority is revoked immediately.

### 6.4 `DataKey` Storage Layout

| Key | Storage | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DataKey::TokenContract` | Instance | `Address` | NFT contract address. Queried on every `execute()` and `__check_auth()`. |
| `DataKey::TokenId` | Instance | `u128` | NFT token ID used in `owner_of()` cross-contract calls. |
| `DataKey::ImplementationHash` | Instance | `BytesN<32>` | WASM hash recorded at init for traceability. |
| `DataKey::Salt` | Instance | `BytesN<32>` | Deployment salt recorded at init for traceability. |
| `DataKey::Initialized` | Instance | `bool` | Re-initialization guard. `AlreadyInitialized` returned if already `true`. |
| `DataKey::Nonce` | Instance | `u64` | Transaction counter. Starts at `0`; incremented on each `execute()`. |

### 6.5 Error Codes

| Code | Name | When Triggered |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize()` called when the `Initialized` flag is already `true`. |
| 2 | `NotInitialized` | `execute()` or `owner()` called before `initialize()` was run. |

---

## 7. Marketplace Contract

**Location:** `soroban-contract/contracts/marketplace/src/lib.rs`

Secondary-market contract for peer-to-peer ticket resale. Sellers list tickets; buyers pay and receive the NFT atomically.

### 7.1 Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `Address` | — | Marketplace administrator. Controls `update_price_cap()` and all upgrade/pause operations. |
| `max_price_multiplier` | `i128` | — | Upper bound multiplier on listing prices. Stored in `PriceCap`; enforcement logic is a planned enhancement (currently only `price > 0` is enforced). |
| `min_price_multiplier` | `i128` | — | Lower bound multiplier. Same implementation note as `max_price_multiplier`. |
| `MaxListingsPerUser` | `u32` | `10` | Per-user listing cap stored at construction. Not yet enforced per-user in `create_listing()` — planned for a future version. |

### 7.2 `PriceCap` Configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_price_multiplier` | `i128` | Set in constructor | Upper cap. Active only when `active = true`. Full multiplier enforcement is a future enhancement. |
| `min_price_multiplier` | `i128` | Set in constructor | Lower cap. Same note. |
| `active` | `bool` | `true` | When `false`, all price cap enforcement is skipped. Toggle via `update_price_cap()`. |

> **Production Note:** The current implementation uses the `Admin` address as the payment token in `purchase_ticket()`. A dedicated SEP-41 token contract should be configured for XLM or USDC payments before mainnet deployment. This requires a contract upgrade.

### 7.3 `DataKey` Storage Layout

| Key | Storage | Value Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Listing(u32)` | Persistent | `Listing` | Full listing record. `listing_id` is a 0-indexed sequential counter. |
| `Sale(u32)` | Persistent | `Sale` | Historical completed sale record. `sale_id` is a 0-indexed sequential counter. |
| `TotalListings` | Persistent | `u32` | Total listings ever created (not just active). Used as the next `listing_id`. |
| `TotalSales` | Persistent | `u32` | Total completed sales. Used as the next `sale_id`. |
| `PriceCap` | Persistent | `PriceCap` | Current price cap policy. Updatable by admin via `update_price_cap()`. |
| `Admin` | Persistent | `Address` | Marketplace admin address. Also used as the payment token placeholder (see production note above). |
| `MaxListingsPerUser` | Persistent | `u32` | Stored per-user listing limit (currently unenforced in `create_listing()`). |

### 7.4 Error Codes

| Code | Name | When Triggered |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ListingNotFound` | `purchase_ticket()` or `cancel_listing()` called with a non-existent `listing_id`. |
| 2 | `ListingNotActive` | `purchase_ticket()` called on a listing whose `active` flag is `false`. |
| 3 | `CannotPurchaseOwnListing` | `buyer == listing.seller` in `purchase_ticket()`. |
| 4 | `PaymentTokenNotConfigured` | `Admin` address not found in persistent storage. |
| 5 | `OnlySellerCanCancel` | `cancel_listing()` caller is not the original listing seller. |
| 6 | `ListingAlreadyInactive` | `cancel_listing()` called on a listing already set to `active = false`. |
| 7 | `PriceMustBePositive` | Reserved; currently checked via panic in `create_listing()`. |
| 8 | `InsufficientBalance` | Reserved; insufficient balance surfaces as a failed `token.transfer()`. |
| 9 | `Unauthorized` | `update_price_cap()` caller does not match the stored admin address. |

---

## 8. Cross-Contract Call Matrix

| Caller | Callee | Function | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EventManager` | `TicketFactory` | `deploy_ticket()` | During `create_event_with_tiers()` — deploys a new NFT contract per event. |
| `EventManager` | `TicketNFT` | `mint_ticket_nft()` | During `purchase_ticket(s)()` — one call per ticket in the quantity. |
| `EventManager` | SEP-41 Token | `transfer()` | During purchase (buyer → contract) and `claim_refund` / `withdraw_funds` (contract → recipient/organizer). |
| `TbaRegistry` | `TicketNFT` | `owner_of()` | Before deploying a TBA to verify the caller is the NFT owner. |
| `TbaRegistry` | `TbaAccount` | `initialize()` | Immediately after deploying each TBA contract. |
| `TbaAccount` | `TicketNFT` | `owner_of()` | On every `execute()` and `__check_auth()` call — live ownership check. |
| `TbaAccount` | Any contract | Any function | Via `execute()` — the TBA relays arbitrary calls on behalf of the NFT owner. |
| `Marketplace` | `TicketNFT` | `balance()` | In `create_listing()` to verify the seller holds tickets. |
| `Marketplace` | SEP-41 Token | `transfer()` | In `purchase_ticket()` to move payment from buyer to seller. |
| `Marketplace` | `TicketNFT` | `transfer_from()` | In `purchase_ticket()` to move the NFT from seller to buyer. |

## 10. Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to mainnet verify each item:

- [ ] Upload `TicketNFT` WASM and record its 32-byte hash.
- [ ] Upload `TbaAccount` WASM and record its 32-byte hash.
- [ ] Deploy `TicketFactory` with `(admin, ticket_nft_wasm_hash)`. Verify `get_admin()` returns the expected address.
- [ ] Deploy `TbaRegistry` with `(admin, tba_account_wasm_hash)`. Verify `ImplementationWasmHash` is set.
- [ ] Deploy `EventManager` and call `initialize(admin, ticket_factory_address)`.
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_EVENT_MANAGER_CONTRACT` in `soroban-client/.env.local`.
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`.
- [ ] Confirm `DEFAULT_TTL_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS` < `DEFAULT_TTL_EXTEND_TO_LEDGERS`. Current values: `518_400 < 1_728_000` ✓
- [ ] Confirm `payment_token` for each event is a deployed SEP-41 token contract (not a placeholder).
- [ ] Replace the Admin-as-payment-token pattern in `Marketplace` before production use.
- [ ] Run `cargo test --release` in `soroban-contract/` — all unit and integration tests must pass.
- [ ] Review fuzz test results for `EventManager` and `TicketNFT` (proptest, 50 cases each).
